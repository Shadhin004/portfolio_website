    <h1 style="text-align:center; color:white;" >Hobby!</h1> <br>
  <h3 style="color:white;"> Hobby is a good thing a person gets from childhood. It can be developed at any age however best to get from childhood. We all do some kind of work according to our interest which can give us happiness and joy that is called hobby. Some people get different hobbies according to their interest, likes and dislikes. There are many type of hobbies we can develop such as dancing, singing, drawing, playing indoor or outdoor game, bird watching, collecting antiques, photography, writing, eating, reading, sports, playing, gardening, music, watching TV, cooking, talking, and so many. Our hobbies help us in earning live hood and make a successful career. Hobby is something we can fully enjoy in our leisure or free time.<br> <br> My hobby is travelling. whenever I get time,I travel a lot. To travel from one place to another for different purposes is generally called travelling. People do not travel always for the same purposes. Someone travels to gain knowledge and experience, someone travels for pleasure, someone travels for business purposes etc. It has much educative value. It is a part of education. Our education and book knowledge remain imperfect without travelling. We can learn many things from travelling. It teaches us to trade and commerce, language, sociology, customs, culture, history, geography and so on. Therefore, the educative value of travelling beggars description. Besides this, there are some special benefits of travelling. If a man stays in one place for a long time, he becomes monotonous. Travelling removes our monotony and gives pleasure. It also broadens our outlook and refreshes our mind. A good traveller can easily educate others. He can give us first-hand knowledge of men and matters of another country. I like travelling very much.</h3>

  <h1 style="text-align:center; color : white ">Favourite quote about Travelling - </h1><br>
  <h4 style="text-align:center ; color:white;"> “Travel isn’t always pretty. It isn’t always comfortable. Sometimes it hurts, it even breaks your heart. But that’s okay. The journey changes you; it should change you. It leaves marks on your memory, on your consciousness, on your heart, and on your body. You take something with you. Hopefully, you leave something good behind.” – <i>Anthony Bourdain</i> </h4>
